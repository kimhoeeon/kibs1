                                        Buyers will look for new features. Price, re sale value and sustainability will be key factors. Brand values will inspire more confidence.

                                        Changes in the global geopolitical situation, and more importantly, in human demographics bring all new challenges and opportunities for businesses competing in the recreational boating industry.<br><br>

                                        As a new cohort of young, affluent buyers enter the global boat market, they bring new demands and new expectations, requiring industries in the sector to adjust and bring increased levels of technology to bear. Today’s buyers increasingly demand greater sustainability, greater onboard comfort, and greater ease of use, challenging the industry.<br><br>

                                        Electrification, automation and connectivity remain key drivers for the recreational boating sector, now joined by demands for advanced technologies including voice controls, gesture controls and fully autonomous boat operation.<br><br>

                                        Companies who meet this challenge stand to reap significant rewards, with the global boat market forecast to reach US$78 billion by 2030.

                                        Automotive autonomy has demonstrated significant value in terms of safety and convenience, with over 90% of modern vehicles now equipped with advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). This progress paves the way for fully autonomous vehicles, such as robotaxis, which are expected to become more common as AI technology advances. In contrast, the development of boat autonomy faces distinct challenges.<br> Unlike cars, boats are subject to unpredictable environmental factors like waves, wind, and currents, while also lacking fixed navigation routes and facing limited visibility below water. Moreover, many boat users are inexperienced, increasing the need for autonomous systems that enhance both safety and operational ease. The key market demands for autonomous boating include systems for long-distance cruising, automated watchkeeping to improve safety, and auto-docking assistance for more efficient marina operations. As autonomous technology is integrated into the leisure boating sector, it has the potential to transform the industry by making boating safer, more accessible, and less dependent on specialized skills. Once its effectiveness is demonstrated, autonomous boating systems are likely to become the standard, requiring early industry collaboration to establish safety and operational standards, similar to the initial development of automotive autonomy.

                                        There are now over 40,000 registered boats. Boat driver licences issued so far exceed 340,000 indicating that leisure boating activity is high and increasing.<br><br>

                                        For the safe enjoyment of all boat users and their families, maintaining/servicing and repairing boats is an essential activity. In Korea over 80% of boats in use have engines.<br><br>

                                        In almost all countries including Korea there are not enough skilled technicians.

                                        EDU Marine is a training program for marine leisure professionals hosted by Gyeonggido and operated by K-Water Operation and Management. The marine leisure industry market is steadily growing, it is still in its early stages of development. One of the major barriers to its expansion in South Korea is the lack of maintenance infrastructure for marine leisure activities. Therefore, it can be said that the cultivation of professionals who can provide marine leisure-related maintenance and customer service is essential for the activation of the marine leisure industry.<br><br>

                                        In response, the Gyeonggi Marine Leisure Workforce Training Center focuses on developing skilled professionals in key areas of marine vessel maintenance, particularly in marine engines (outboard and inboard) and hull repair. The program also supports employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. Additionally, it offers emergency response training and basic marine engine maintenance courses for boat owners and users, ensuring a safer and more enjoyable marine leisure experience.

                                        South Devon College and EDUmarine have been working together since 2015.<br><br>

                                        We are a Further Education College and University with five campus locations in South Devon, UK. 700 staff members support 10,000 students. Our Marine Academy first opened in 2010 is now located in a custom designed and purpose-built waterside facility that specialises in training for the maritime workforce, an industry with significant skill shortages.<br><br>

                                        Our ethos is to work closely with our industry partners to fuel careers and bridge the skills gap.
